00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:09,472
Hello welcome to this part of physics this is intended to be the first course in physics which is

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:15,872
Concerned with the study of the properties of matter including motion

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:21,760
Power of the portal and systems of Pasco

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:27,392
I am Professor Cinema

5
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:36,608
A professor of physics at University university is situated in heaven

6
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:45,056
A town in Jordan and I thought the physics courses ranging from freshman to

7
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:50,688
Graduate-level courses in different aspects

8
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:56,832
The course material

9
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,208
Will include various aspects as a mansion

10
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,096
The first chapter

11
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:13,984
What would be naturally concerned with measurements

12
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,872
And units used for that purpose

13
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,016
And this also includes

14
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:35,744
Factor analysis for four quantities which need the direction to be specifically

15
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Also this course will include

16
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:52,128
A chapter concerned with the description of motion of a single particle or an object which

17
00:01:52,384 --> 00:02:01,600
Wolves like the motion of a single particle meaning if we endure the effects of rotation and changing the size of someone

18
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,488
The shape of the object also

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,120
This course will be concerned is the third chapter

20
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:22,592
With the study of the Dynamics of a particle or an object simulating the motion of a single particle

21
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,480
This field is concerned with the

22
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:35,904
Relation between the motion and the causes of the motion

23
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,048
Off the system of particles under consideration

24
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:53,568
The 4th chapter of this course will be concerned with the study of the system

25
00:02:53,824 --> 00:03:03,040
Of particles in an object we apply in that span the same rules and principles of a

26
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:08,416
In the Peter chapter 2 study Costco

27
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:18,144
He sits chapter of the scores will be concerned with the study of

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:27,616
Motion of rigid bodies in the game we rely on the same principles and methods

29
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:32,992
Save Alex chapter 2 study the motion of rigid body

30
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:43,744
Chapter 6 will be concerned with the study of the motion of fluids ticular Lee ideal fluid

31
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:53,984
And finally the 7th chapter of the course will be concerned with the study of hair Medina

32
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,360
Mechanical properties of material

33
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:05,504
In this first person

34
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,648
We are concerned with the study

35
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:21,375
Of the units and standard used for measurement

36
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:30,079
The first lecture will be focusing on units and standard

37
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,711
Second rupture of this chapter will

38
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,087
Be concerned with the analysis

39
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:50,303
In this lecture we will first
